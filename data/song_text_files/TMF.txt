TAYLOR MADE FREESTYLE

Yeah, unc', that's the truth
I'm definitely 'bout to come around the Lang gang and let my fuckin' bowel move
Shittin' on you niggas from a whole different altitude
High up in the sky like I'm Howard Hughes
The first one really only took me an hour or two
The next one is really 'bout to bring out the coward in you
But now we gotta wait a fuckin' week 'cause Taylor Swift is your new Top
And if you 'bout to drop, she gotta approve
This girl really 'bout to make you act like you not in a feud
She tailor-made your schedule with Ant, you out of the loop
Hate all you corporate industry puppets, I'm not in the mood
I love it when you niggas talk loose like I'm not in the room
Since "Like That," your tone changed a little, you not as enthused
How are you not in the booth? It feel like you kinda removed
You tryna let this shit die down, nah, nah, nah
Not this time, nigga, you followin' through
I guess you need another week to figure out how to improve
What the fuck is taking so long? We waitin' on you
The rest of y'all are definitely involved, y'all gettin' it too
Soon as you get the courage to drop, I'm out on the loose, on the loose
Yeah, shout out to Taylor Swift
Biggest gangster in the music game right now
You know, I moved my album when she dropped, I said that already
You know, she 'bout to milli' run through a Milly Rock on your head top, well
She got the whole pgLang on mute like that Beyonc√© challenge, y'all boys quiet for the weekend, like
Dot, I know you're in that NY apartment, you strugglin' right now, I know it
In the notepad doing lyrical gymnastics, my boy
You better have a motherfuckin' quintuple entendre on that shit
Some shit I don't even understand, like
That shit better be crazy, we waitin' on you
Yeah
